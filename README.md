This web app was built to demonstrate proficency using the JS framework React.

This is a Single Page Application.

React features in this app:

- Reusable components
- Context to store and share data between components

The web app is a simple memory game. Players try and select as many rugby clubs as possible, without selecting the same one twice. The game is made more difficult by shuffling the order of the clubs each time a player makes a selection.

This web app has been optimised for mobile devices.
